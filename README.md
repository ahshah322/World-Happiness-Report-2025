# 🌍 World Happiness Report 2025 — Data Analysis & Visualization

### 📊 Overview
This project explores the **World Happiness Report 2025** dataset to understand how social, economic, and personal factors contribute to happiness across nations.  
Using Python libraries like **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**, we visualize relationships between GDP, social support, health, freedom, generosity, and corruption perception.

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **pandas**, **numpy**
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn**
- **Google Colab**

### 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is the official **World Happiness Report 2025** (CSV format) containing:
- Country name  
- Regional indicator  
- Ladder score (Happiness Score)  
- Log GDP per capita  
- Social support  
- Healthy life expectancy  
- Freedom to make life choices  
- Generosity  
- Perceptions of corruption

### 🔍 Key Analyses & Visualizations
1. **GDP vs. Happiness** — explores how economic prosperity affects happiness.  
2. **Regional GDP Contribution** — shows GDP share by region (pie chart).  
3. **Correlation Heatmap** — displays relationships among happiness factors.  
4. **Perception of Corruption** — compares corruption perceptions across regions.  
5. **Life Expectancy Comparison** — contrasts top and bottom 10 happiest countries.  
6. **Freedom vs. Happiness** — highlights the role of freedom in well-being.  
7. **Most & Least Corrupt Countries** — identifies global corruption extremes.  
8. **Corruption vs. Happiness** — visualizes their inverse relationship.
